# LeetCode Daily Coding Tracker  

This repository is dedicated to tracking my **daily problem-solving journey** on **LeetCode**. I will be solving problems across multiple topics, refining my approach, and maintaining a structured collection of solutions for future reference.  

## 📌 Goals  
- Solve **daily coding problems** across different **data structures & algorithms**.  
- Maintain a well-structured and **organized repository** for easy revision.  
- Continuously **update and refine solutions** as I improve.  
- **Track progress** and build a strong coding habit.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
This repository is organized based on **topics**, with solutions categorized accordingly:  

```
📂 LeetCode-Solutions
