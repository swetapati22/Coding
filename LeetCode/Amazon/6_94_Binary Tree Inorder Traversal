##################### QUESTION #####################
# 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal - Easy

# Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.
# Example 1:
# Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
# Output: [1,3,2]

# Example 2:
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,8,null,null,6,7,9]
# Output: [4,2,6,5,7,1,3,9,8]

# Example 3:
# Input: root = []
# Output: []

# Example 4:
# Input: root = [1]
# Output: [1]

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
 
# Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

##################### SOLUTION #####################

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

            APPROACH Recussion:
            - Inorder = left child, root, right (l+r)
            - Start from root, call recussion on left, till left exists.
            - Once curr.left is null, add curr_node to res.
            - Call recurssion on right,this becomes the new node and keep doing l+r
            - Repeat untill we reach end of the recurssion stack that is till we reach the root node back. 
            - Return result
                Time complexity: O(n)
                Space complexity: O(n)
        
            APPROACH Iterative:
            - Inorder = left child, root, right (l+r)
            - Start from root that becomes the curr_node and we add each node to the stack that we visit.
            - Keep checking root.left till it exists - when null - pop that from the stack and add to result.
            - Move the curr to curr.right and treat this as the new root and keep repeating untill the stack is empty.
            - Return result
                Time complexity: O(n)
                Space complexity: O(n) # worst case if all the leaves are left nodes.
